Hi all, 

Thanks for checking out Lemmings! As of right now it is in beta and mostly working but there are some bugs and some unfinished portions. I am planning to supply better documentation and some tutorials in the next couple of weeks but at the moment I wanted to make sure that the fundamental code was available in case people were interested in trying it out.

The best email to reach me at is Justin.Berry@yale.edu and until I get all of the tutorials recorded please feel free to reach out directly for guidance on getting started if you want to explore its possibilities.

This was produced through my work at the Yale Center for Immersive Technology in Pediatrics and the lab within it, XRPediatrics (XRpeds.org).
