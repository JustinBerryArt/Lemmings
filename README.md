Hi all, 

Thanks for checking out Lemmings! As of right now it is in beta and mostly working but there are some bugs and some unfinished portions. The documentation that can help with getting started and providing insights into the code can be found at lemmings.xrpeds.org. I am still working on getting some demo projects together and creating video tutorials and will update here when those are ready.

The best email to reach me at is Justin.Berry@yale.edu, feel free to reach out directly for guidance on getting started if you want to explore its possibilities or need help getting it going.

This was produced through my work at the Yale Center for Immersive Technology in Pediatrics and the lab within it, XRPediatrics (XRpeds.org).
